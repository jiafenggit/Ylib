		<hr width="100%" />
		<br />		The ystrings are a type of buffered strings. When you get a  ystring, you get a pointer to a character string. It is a  (char*) pointer, as for any C's character string. But, in fact, there is more allocated memory than used memory. It is usefull to extend the string without new memory allocation and copy.  And before the address of the first character of the string, there is two integers ; the first that contains the total allocated size (used string memory + '0' + free memory size) ; the second that contains the used memory size. The used size  doesn't count the ending '0' character of the string.<br /><br />
